# Agency App

This is an application that showcases the power of Gatsby for creating a fully working site that can be used for an agency to advertise
there business, or for an individual looking to showcase their abilities. Gatsby is a great choice for just about any website idea you
can think of. I believe that this site will show off the capabilities of what Gatsby can do as well as what a developer using Gatsby
can create.
